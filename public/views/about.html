    I'm a web developer with a passion for connecting users with data that enriches their lives. I thrive on teams whose work includes time spent learning new technologies and directly helping users in an impactful and measurable way. I'm fond of asking questions and paired programming. Iâ€™m also a bit of a data nerd.</p>

    I've worked in bookstores, libraries, and volunteered full time. When not coding, you'll most likely find me reading or <a href="/writing">writing</a> strange short stories.
