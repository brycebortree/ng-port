      I'm a web developer with a passion for user-friendly designs and clean back-end work. I am passionate about responsive web design and connecting users with information that enriches their lives. Iâ€™m a bit of a data nerd.</p>

      I've worked in bookstores, libraries, and in a halfway house in my past lives. I'm firmly a cat person. When not coding, you'll most likely find me reading or writing.
