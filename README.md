<h1>Angular Portfolio</h1>

<img alt="bryce bortree's portfolio site" src="/public/assets/biglogoblack.png">


<p>I rebuilt my portfolio website using Angular to better show off my SPA abilities. I created a clean but not bland design with simple FontAwesome icons and a clean lefthand menu panel that toggles on small devices.</p>

<p>I built the base of my app using my own <a href="https://github.com/brytree/angular-base">angular base</a> recipe.</p>

<p>If you have anything you'd like to share about the website, please feel free to message me here or send me an email.</p>
